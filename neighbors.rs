//! A crate with the most common Neighborhoods

type Point = (usize, usize);

/// Defines how a Path can move along the Grid.
///
/// Different Scenarios may have different constraints as to how a Path may be formed.
/// For example if Agents can only move along the 4 cardinal directions, any Paths generated should
/// reflect that by only containing those steps.
///
/// This Trait is a generalized solution to that problem. It provides a function to query all
/// neighboring Points of an existing Point and a Heuristic for how long it might take to reach
/// a goal from a Point.
///
/// The most common implementations of this Trait are already provided by this Module:
/// - [`ManhattanNeighborhood`] for Agents that can move
/// up, down, left or right
/// - [`MooreNeighborhood`] for Agents that can move
/// up, down, left, right, as well as the 4 diagonals (up-right, ...)

	fn get_all_neighbors(&self, point: Point) -> Box<dyn Iterator<Item = Point>>;
	/// Gives a Heuristic for how long it takes to reach `goal` from `point`.
	///
	/// This is usually the Distance between the two Points in the Metric of your Neighborhood.
	///
	/// If there is no proper way of calculation how long it takes, simply return 0. This will
	/// increase the time it takes to calculate the Path, but at least it will always be correct.
